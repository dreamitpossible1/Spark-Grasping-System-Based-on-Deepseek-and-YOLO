## Project Title
Spark Grasping System for RB3 Gen2 Based on Deepseek and YOLO


## Overview
This project delivers a Spark grasping system for the RB3 Gen2, powered by Deepseek and YOLO. Leveraging the RB3 Gen2‚Äôs advanced motion control and sensor technologies, the platform establishes a robust foundation. YOLO handles real-time object detection, rapidly identifying target objects within the environment, while Deepseek drives decision-making by analyzing data to formulate optimal grasping strategies. Working in concert, these components enable the robotic arm to execute grasping tasks with both high efficiency and precision. Integration of the Qualcomm¬Æ Intelligent Robotics Product SDK ensures seamless interoperability among all system modules and further elevates overall reliability.

## Quick Start with uArm Swift Pro

1. Download [uArm-Python-SDK](https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK.git)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK.git
```
2. Installation
```bash
   python setup.py install
```

## ü¶æ Project Overview

This project is based on the uArm Swift Pro robotic arm, which mainly consists of the following components:

- **End Effector**: Equipped with a suction pump, used for picking up and moving Mahjong tiles.
- **Drive System**: Composed of four servo motors, each controlling one degree of freedom (4-DoF), enabling precise and smooth motion control.
- **Control System**: An integrated controller that supports both Arduino and Python development environments, serving as the core control unit of the robotic arm.
 
> ‚ú≥Ô∏è The uArm Swift Pro is a four-axis (4-DoF) robotic manipulator known for its high precision and repeatability, making it ideal for lightweight object manipulation and interactive gaming tasks.
